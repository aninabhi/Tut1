##Variables### 
You can assign a value to a variable using the = operator.

 Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
They cannot start with a number.
Python is case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar are different variables.
Avoid using reserved words as variable names.


####Data Types###:
Variables in Python can hold different types of data. Common data types include integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and more.s

Variables  can store in these way in python : 

name , price , weight = 'soap' , 15 , 50.5 

###Variables Rules####: 

1) Name can contains alpha-numric characters and underscore .
2) Name should start with letter or underscore character .
3) Keyword should not be used .
4) varaibles are case-sensitive .


###Literals#### 
If value is directly store  in the variables and it is constant , than its literals .
Eg : price = 300 ( here value is directly assign to variable throughout the programme , 
Or we also can take the inputs from user and that variable also called literals . 
Eg : price = input(“enter the price value”)

All values which constant in float , integer , Boolean .  

Literals also can be written in _ separation also  as  s = 123_435_434_432



'12'
>>>
>>> bin(12)
'0b1100'
>>> bin(price)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
>>> octal(12)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'octal' is not defined
>>> octa(12)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'octa' is not defined. Did you mean: 'oct'?
>>> hex(12)
'0xc'
>>> oct(12)


'0o14'


note Coversion to decimal of float to binary number is not allowed and in complex you can change the real value in binary .



***Conversion Eg##### : 
NameError: name 'octa' is not defined. Did you mean: 'oct'?

>>>
>>> b = 16
>>> bin(b)
'0b10000'
>>> oct(b)
'0o20'
>>> hex(b)
'0x10'
